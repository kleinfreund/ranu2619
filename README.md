This is the repository for a small website related to my Computer Science and Media studies. It is a collection of solved exercises and a link collection for me and my class mates.

If you want to add something to the link collection, itâ€™s currently the easiest to [open an issue](https://github.com/kleinfreund/ranu2619/issues/new).
